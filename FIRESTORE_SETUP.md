# Firestore Setup Guide

## Enable Firestore Database

Your application is now integrated with Firebase Firestore for backend data storage, but Firestore needs to be enabled first.

### Steps to Enable Firestore:

1. **Open Firebase Console**
   - Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/notesapp-89d19/firestore
   - Or navigate to your project → Firestore Database

2. **Create Database**
   - Click "Create database"
   - Choose "Start in test mode" (for development)
   - Select a location (choose the closest to your users)
   - Click "Done"

3. **Security Rules (Important!)**
   After creating the database, update the security rules for production:
   ```javascript
   rules_version = '2';
   service cloud.firestore {
     match /databases/{database}/documents {
       // Allow read/write access to productionApps collection
       match /productionApps/{document} {
         allow read, write: if true; // Change this for production!
       }
     }
   }
   ```

### What This Enables:

✅ **Persistent Data Storage** - Applications are saved to the cloud  
✅ **Real-time Updates** - Changes appear instantly across all devices  
✅ **Data Synchronization** - Multiple users can manage applications  
✅ **Offline Support** - Works even when internet is slow  

### After Enabling Firestore:

1. The applications screen will automatically connect to the database
2. All add/edit/delete operations will be saved permanently
3. Data will persist across browser sessions and devices

### Test the Integration:

1. Go to `/prodapps` route
2. Add a new application
3. Check Firebase Console → Firestore to see the data
4. Refresh the page - data should still be there!

**Note**: The current rules allow anyone to read/write. For production, implement proper authentication and security rules.
